# ArtistPages

- Artist Pages - A website that gives the user a quick display of artists most recent releases

# About

- This site uses the Spotify API to make non-personal requests

* This site will display artists profile information such as their name follower count as well as the date of their latest release with the name and picture

- Clicking on the profile portion of the artist will bring you to the artists Spotify page

* Clicking on the Latest Release portion will bring you to the Spotify page for that album or song

- Artist profile information and Album/Track information is called at startup and then stored inside of system objects to reduce calls to the API

* This information is set to be valid for 15 mins and will be refreshed from the API if a user loads the ArtistPage 15 mins after the previous request

- The access token for the API will also be stored and refreshed when it nears its expiration of 60 Mins
